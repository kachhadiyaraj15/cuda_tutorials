# What is Memory Coalescing?
- Imagine your GPU has a very wide data highway to its global memory. This highway is designed to mode large chunks of data at once, say 32 bytes, 64 bytes, or even 128 bytes(for modern GPUs, often 128 bytes is the basic memory transaction size).<br><br>

- When a **WARP** (a group of 32 threads, the fundamanetsl unit of execution on an NVIDIA GPU) needs to access global memory, the GPU's memory controller tries to combine the individual memory requests from all 32 threads into as few large transactions as possible. 

    - **Coaleasced Access** : If all 32 threads in a warp request data from contiguous memory locations, the GPU can fulfill these requests in a single, wide memory transaction. This is like sendig one big truck down the highway, full of data. This is highly efficient.

    - **Uncoalesced Access**: If threads in a warp request data from scattered, non-contiguous memory locations, the GPU has to perform multiple, smaller memory transactions to gather all the data. This is like sending many small trucks, often partially empty, down the highway. This is highly inefficient and leads to wasted bandwidth.

### Why is Coalescing Important?
Global memory access is the slowest operation on a GPU. GPUs have thousands of cores, but their peak performance is often limited by how fast they can feed data to these cores. Maximizing coalescing means:

- **Better Bandwidth Utilization**: You're using the memory highway to its fullest capacity.
- **Reduced Latency**: Fewer, larger transactions mean less overhead and faster completion of memory requests.
- **Higher Throughput**: Your kernels spend less time waiting for data and more time computing.

### How it Works (The Mechanics on the GPU)
NVIDIA GPUs typically access global memory in segments (or "cache lines"). For example, a common segment size is 128 bytes.

When a warp performs a global memory access:

1. The GPU examines the memory addresses requested by all active threads in the warp.
2. If all 32 threads request data within the same 128-byte segment, and their accesses are sequential (e.g., thread 0 asks for byte 0, thread 1 for byte 4, thread 2 for byte 8, and so on, filling up the 128-byte segment), the GPU can perform a single, full-bandwidth transaction.
3. If accesses are scattered, the GPU has to perform multiple 128-byte transactions (one for each unique 128-byte segment accessed by any thread in the warp). This leads to fetching more data than necessary and multiple trips to memory, even if each thread only needs a few bytes.
